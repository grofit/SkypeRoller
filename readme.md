# SkypeRoller

SkypeRoller is an application that hooks into skype and allows you to make dice rolls automatically.

The dice commands should be entered like so:

//1d6 or //2d8+5 or even //10d100-25

## Setup

Download the current SkypeRoller build and run the executable contained, or download the project and compile, then run the resulting exe file.

## Development

This was a simple project done on a train journey, so no tests or build files have been written currently, I will try to add some of these later with a basic pre-built download.

## Future

This meets the criteria I have, so the logic wont change too much unless there is an issue with it, although if anyone is a regex whiz feel free to add support for multiple rolls within one command, like: //(1d20-1d4)+(2d100+10)*2
