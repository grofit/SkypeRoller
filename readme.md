# SkypeRoller

SkypeRoller is an application that hooks into skype and allows you to make dice rolls automatically.

The dice commands should be entered like so:

//1d6 or //2d8+5 or even //10d100-25

## Setup

Download the project and compile, then run the resulting exe file. It will do the rest from there.

## Development

This was a simple project done on a train journey, so no tests or build files have been written currently, I will try to add some of these later with a basic pre-built download.
